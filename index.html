        <h1>ORAC Submission Checker</h1>
        This is a tool to check submissions from the site <a href="https://orac2.info">orac2.info</a>. The problem id is the number that is at the end of the URL of orac problems. <br>
        Sorry that I haven't added any CSS yet so this looks ugly. Also, this is quite buggy because sometimes the CORS Proxy is down.<br><br>
        <hr>
        Username: <input id="user" type="text" placeholder="Enter your ORAC username"><br>
        Problem ID: <input id="problem_id" type="text" placeholder="Enter the Problem ID that you want to check"><br><br>
        <button onclick="check()">Check</button><br><br>
        <hr>
        <div id="result">The result will appear here.</div>
        <hr>
        <h1>Manual Version</h1>
        If you want to manually use this (like if the CORS Proxy is down or buggy for some reason), just include the link:<br>
